            <p class="edu-text">
              Completed foundational coursework in electrical and electronic systems, including DC circuits and digital circuits with associated laboratory work.
              This program provided early hands-on exposure to electrical concepts, instrumentation, and practical problem-solving, strengthening my technical intuition
              and troubleshooting skills.
            </p>

            <p class="edu-text">
              After gaining this applied foundation, I transitioned to the Electrical Engineering program to pursue deeper theoretical and system-level understanding.
              The combination of applied and analytical training continues to inform my approach to field diagnostics, commissioning activities, and engineering decision-making.
