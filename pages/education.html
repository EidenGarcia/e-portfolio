        <h2 class="edu-degree">Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering Technology (BSEET)</h2>
        <p class="edu-dates">Aug 2018 – Dec 2019</p>

        <p class="edu-text">
          Completed foundational coursework in electrical and electronic systems, including DC circuits and digital
          circuits with associated laboratory work. This program provided early hands-on exposure to electrical concepts,
          instrumentation, and practical problem-solving, strengthening my technical intuition and troubleshooting skills.
        </p>

        <p class="edu-text">
          After gaining this applied foundation, I transitioned to the Electrical Engineering program to pursue deeper
          theoretical and system-level understanding. The combination of applied and analytical training continues to
          inform my approach to field diagnostics, commissioning activities, and engineering decision-making.

        <p class="edu-dates">Dec 2019 – Dec 2024</p>

        <p class="edu-text">
          Completed a concentration in Power &amp; Systems with emphasis on power system analysis, protection and
          coordination, and transmission and distribution systems. Upper-level coursework included Power Systems
          Analysis, Power Electronics, Transmission &amp; Distribution, and advanced circuit analysis, providing a
          rigorous foundation for modeling, fault analysis, protection coordination, and reliability evaluation in
          distribution networks.

        <p class="edu-text">
          This academic training directly supports my work in grid automation and reliability, where I apply power system
          fundamentals to feeder modeling, protection studies, and evaluation of cost-effective reliability improvements.
          Graduated <strong>Cum Laude</strong>.
